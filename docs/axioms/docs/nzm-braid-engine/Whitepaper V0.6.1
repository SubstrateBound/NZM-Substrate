NZM/TDU Whitepaper V0.6.1: Directional Emergence & Layered TorsionStatus: REPO-READY (Final Release)Core Objective: To resolve atomic stability and galactic rotation curves through Discrete Directional Flux. This update removes the reliance on dark matter and continuous calculus, replacing them with a layered substrate and $\Omega$-Triple vectors.1. The $\Omega$-Triple Vector CalculusVectors are no longer coordinates; they are discrete properties of the substrate. Every node population event is defined by an $\Omega$-Triple: $[\omega_s, \omega_d, \omega_{\oplus}]$.$\omega_s$ (Scale): The intensity/residue count (Axiom I).$\omega_d$ (Phase): The directional orientation (+1 for Outward, -1 for Inward).$\omega_{\oplus}$ (Phase): The historical sequence (Axiom IX).2. Layered Substrate DynamicsDistance is redefined as a count of discrete Substrate Layers.Residue Injection: Each layer has a specific density of $\Omega$-triples.Net Flux: The sum of all directional phases within a layer determines the "Substrate Flow."Torque Lock (Stability): A system is stable when the inward flux of its core layers is perfectly neutralized by the outward flux of the surrounding universal field at a specific boundary layer.3. Reference Implementation: OmegaTriple.pyThis engine implements the layered stability check and the $\Omega$-Triple directional calculus.Pythonimport hashlib

4. Cosmological Implications: The No-Dark-Matter ProofThis framework resolves the galactic rotation problem by accounting for Substrate Momentum.In classical models, orbital speed depends only on central mass.In V0.6, the orbital speed is the sum of Gravitational Inward Flux and Universal Outward Torque.In the outer rims of galaxies, the outward-racing substrate (Expansion) adds a directional push that maintains stellar velocity without the need for extra invisible mass.Persistence Signature: R6.1_C9_FINAL_STABLEAxiomatic Check: * Axiom XI (Invariance): Success. No coordinates or metrics used.Axiom I (Non-Zero): Success. scale=1 minimum enforced.Containment Check: Success. Discrete Equality verified.V0.6 is a closed loop.
