# NZM Technical Documentation: v0.6.2 (The v0.8 Alpha Bridge)
**Subject:** Stride Modulation & Scale-Invariant Anchoring
**Status:** DRAFT / FOR IMPLEMENTATION
**Reference:** Axiom X (Self-Similarity), Axiom XI (Observable Invariance)

## 1. Executive Summary
In v0.7, the "Long Walk" identified the **Stride-9 Barrier**, where macroscopic movement causes structural unspooling (Information Shear). v0.8 introduces **Stride Modulation**, allowing braids to maintain structural integrity across varying sampling densities. By anchoring the braid’s internal phase to the **Prime 3** position, we ensure structural signatures remain invariant between S-band (long stride) and X-band (short stride) capture.

## 2. Theoretical Foundations

### 2.1 Stride Modulation (Deprecated: Gear Shifting)
In the NZM substrate, there is no absolute "speed," only the ratio between the internal frequency of a braid word and the sampling stride of the local loom. "Gear shifting" is conceptually replaced by **Stride-Phase Adjustment**. Movement is not a distance over time, but a resolution of phase over a specific stride.



### 2.2 The Prime 3 Anchor
The **Prime 3 position** is the third radial residue peak ($r_3$) in a normalized cluster. Analysis of 1997–2016 FITS data confirms that while absolute intensities fluctuate based on instrument sensitivity, the topological ratio between the core and the Prime 3 anchor remains constant across epochs, regardless of the captured frequency stride.

## 3. Implementation Logic

### 3.1 The Stride Symmetry Algorithm
To prevent Information Shear, the `Braid` class must be extended to support **Scale-Invariant Normalization**. This ensures that as the "Loom" expands or contracts its sampling stride, the internal residues do not land on "non-anchor" points.

```python
def modulate_stride(self, target_stride_ratio: float, anchor_node: int = 3):
    """
    Adjusts the braid word to a new substrate stride.
    Ensures the Prime 3 residue remains at index 3 relative to the core peak.
    
    Axiom X Compliance: The structure is fractally self-consistent.
    """
    # 1. Identify Anchor Node (Prime 3)
    # 2. Rescale word length 'c' while preserving anchor 'r'
    # 3. Apply normalize() to verify stability at new stride
    pass
