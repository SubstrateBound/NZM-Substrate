# NZM Technical Documentation: v0.9 (Alpha)
**Subject:** Topological Convergence & The Interference Loom  
**Status:** CONCEPTUAL / RESEARCH FRONTIER  
**Reference:** Axiom VII (Coherence), Axiom X (Self-Similarity)

## 1. Executive Summary
v0.9 marks the transition from **Isolated Braids** to the **Interference Loom**. While v0.8 established scale-invariant anchoring via the Prime 3 position to handle scale jumps, v0.9 defines the emergence of collective structure. In this layer, "Distance" is redefined as the **Topological Phase-Shift** between distinct braid clusters interacting on a shared, non-zero substrate.

## 2. Theoretical Foundations

### 2.1 The Interference Loom
Per Axiom VII, oscillatory patterns phase-lock. The background "Ambient Hum" is treated as a universal loom. Braids (Matter-Clusters) do not move *through* a vacuum; they modulate the phase of this loom. Motion is the re-braiding of the loom's local nodes.



### 2.2 Convergence of Multi-Stride Data
v0.9 overlays the Prime 3 anchors of disparate captures (e.g., 1997 S-band vs. 2016 X-band). Alignment of these anchors identifies a **Common Substrate Node**. Disalignment—or "Slip"—identifies regions of high relational density, classically interpreted as gravitational curvature.

## 3. Implementation Logic

### 3.1 The Phase-Lock Algorithm
The engine tracks the **Relational Distance** as a combinatorial delta between braid words.

```python
def check_convergence(braid_a, braid_b):
    """
    Determines phase-lock status. If residues align, coherence is 
    achieved (Axiom VII).
    """
    # Convergence is a function of residue overlap, not metric proximity.
    convergence_factor = calculate_residue_overlap(braid_a, braid_b)
    return convergence_factor > EPSILON_FLOOR
```

### 3.3 The No-Annihilation Collision
In v0.9, when two braids converge perfectly ($1 - 1$), they do not vanish. They form a **Super-Residue**. This is the highest stability class in the NZM engine, representing the formation of **"Substrate Crystals" (Heavy Matter)**. This state is the ultimate expression of Axiom VIII: Information cannot be erased, only compressed into higher-order persistence.

## 4. Forward Expectations for v1.0

### 4.1 Substrate Mapping
Complete reconstruction of the local galactic neighborhood using only Persistence Signatures ($R\{r\}_C\{c\}$). By mapping the phase-locked residues, we derive the "Map" from the "Hum."

### 4.2 Temporal Flow
Proving that **"Time"** is simply the rate of normalization across the Loom. The "Arrow of Time" is the irreversible direction of braid reduction; it is the substrate's inherent drive toward stability.

## 5. Axiomatic Compliance Report

* **Axiom VII (Coherence)**: Convergence is the physical manifestation of phase-locking. Structure is a byproduct of phase-locked oscillations.
* **Axiom IX (Dissolution)**: Clusters can de-cohere and shed residues (Entropy), but the Loom preserves the total residue history. No data is lost to a "zero" state.
* **Axiom XI (Invariance)**: Convergence is measured by discrete comparability (equality or dominance), never by continuous limits, vanishing points, or real-valued projections.
