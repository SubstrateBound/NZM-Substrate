NZM Technical Paper v0.7: The Substrate Friction Limit
Abstract
In the Non-Zero Substrate (NZM), movement is a series of discrete Resolution Events. v0.7 maps the "Long Walk"—the high-cost transit of a Golden-9 Braid across a high-density S1 environment. We conclude that at S1, information integrity is a function of tick-accumulation.

1. The S1 Displacement Law
Movement requires the Loom to re-verify the Braid's phase at every node.

Operation: P_next = P ⊕ 1.

Cost: Each step triggers a Clink Check.

The Complexity Tax: For the Golden-9 (C9), every step requires the Loom to process the internal phase of the braid.

Axiom III (Bounded Accumulation): Work (W) accumulates as W = N x C. There is no "free" momentum at the S1 scale.

2. The Mercury-Scale Obstacle (Residue Density)
Mercury-scale environments are characterized by High Relational Density (Axiom IV).

Substrate Noise: The "floor" is littered with S1 residues.

The Drag Coefficient: As the Golden-9 moves, its internal nodes frequently land on non-anchor points.

Result: Information Shear. The Braid must pay in Ticks to reconcile its phase with the noisy floor.

3. Failure Mode: The Stride-9 Barrier
The defining discovery of v0.7 was the limit of "Natural Speed."

The Attempt: Increasing the Stride to 9 nodes without Phase Compression.

The Result: The Loom samples at S9, but the Braid still exists at S3.

The Shear: The "Middle" and "Tail" of the braid land on non-anchors.

Outcome: The Braid unspools into raw thermal noise.
