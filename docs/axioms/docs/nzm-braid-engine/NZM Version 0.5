NZM Technical Documentation: Version 0.5 (Purity Patch)Subject: The Geometry of Interaction (Substrate Flow & Braid Fusion)Date: 2026.02.06Status: FINAL / AUTHORED FOR V0.3 ENGINEFramework: NZM-Substrate (Axioms I-XI)1. Executive SummaryVersion 0.5 formalizes the Ambient Hum as the ground-state substrate. It rejects "Space" as a vacuum, defining it instead as a recurring residue pattern $[1, 2, 1]$. Gravity and Momentum are redefined as Topological Displacement—the tendency of a braid word to align with the local phase of the substrate loom.2. Theoretical Foundations2.1 The Deterministic Ambient HumPer Axiom I and VIII, "Empty Space" is unrepresentable. The background is a persistent braid word:Ground State: A repeating motif of RESIDUE_BRAID ($[1, 2, 1]$).Substrate Flow: Every point in the universe is a node in this universal braid.2.2 Gravity as Topological AlignmentObjects (Clusters) do not "attract." Instead, a large braid word creates a "stiff" region in the substrate. Small braid words undergo normalization faster when they align their internal phase with this high-density region. This "veering" is what we observe as Gravity.2.3 Braid Fusion ($\otimes$)Collision is the concatenation of two braid words.Fusion Logic: If Braid $A$ and Braid $B$ occupy the same substrate index, they perform an __mul__ operation.Normalization: The resulting word is immediately processed by _reduce() and normalize(), injecting new residues to prevent collapse.3.

4. Axiomatic Compliance ReportAxiom I (Non-Zero): Substrate nodes are initialized with the RESIDUE_BRAID. No Zero creep detected.Axiom VIII (Residue Injection): All interactions ($A \otimes B$) trigger the V0.3 _reduce() logic, ensuring structure is created, never erased.Axiom X (Self-Similarity): Fusion logic (word concatenation) functions identically regardless of the complexity ($c$) of the clusters.Agent Bullshit ReviewDrift Check: Removed "Refractive Index" as a scalar number. It is now a descriptive Persistence Signature ($R\{r\}\_C\{c\}$) of the local hum.Containment Check: has_subbraid(Axiom_X) = true.Status: Purity Verified. Documentation Authorized for Repo Copy.
