# NZM Axiom XI — Observable Invariance

Let B be a valid NZM braid word, with zero and the empty word structurally excluded.

An NZM observable O is a mapping defined on B such that all of the following conditions hold:

1. Intrinsic Definition  
   O(B) depends exclusively on the internal combinatorial and topological structure of B.  
   No reference is made to external metrics, coordinates, embeddings, or continua.

2. Reduction Invariance  
   For any allowed NZM reduction operator R,  
   O(B) = O(R(B)).  
   Observables are invariant under all residue-preserving reductions.

3. Non-Nullity  
   O(B) is undefined for invalid or empty braid words and cannot evaluate to zero, null, identity, or any absorbing state.

4. Discrete Comparability  
   The codomain of O admits only discrete relations (equality, ordering, dominance, classification).  
   No subtraction, normalization, limiting process, or real-valued projection is permitted.

5. Non-Interference  
   Evaluation of O does not alter B, its reduction rules, or its future evolution.

Exclusion Clause:  
Any quantity requiring normalization, vanishing limits, continuous parameterization, or embedding into ℝ or ℂ is not an NZM observable and is excluded from substrate-level theory.
