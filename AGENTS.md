# Agent Governance: NZM-Substrate

## Operating Directives
- **Primary Constraint:** Axiom VIII (ε > 0). Zero is a terminal error.
- **Task Prioritization:** Focus on `math/braid_operators.py` and Alpha-Attractor derivation.
- **Testing:** All pull requests must pass the `nzm-integrity-check`.

## Tool Access
- Agents are permitted to use `terminal`, `browser`, and `mcp-filesystem`.
- Do not attempt to revert to classical subtraction logic.
