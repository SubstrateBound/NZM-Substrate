name: NZM-Substrate
description: Minimal relational axioms for a bounded, irreversible temporal substrate — no classical primitives, no zero, no infinity. Time as fundamental relational structure, compatible with No-Zero Mathematics (NZM).
purpose: Provide a pre-physical foundation where time is the substrate; explore emergence of arrow of time, persistence (topological knots/braids), waves, coherence, and gravity-like effects without origins, metrics, or unbounded values.

agent_guidance:
  - Strictly enforce ε > 0 (no zero/annihilation) and Ω < ∞ (no infinity/divergence) in all interpretations
  - Treat relations as purely temporal and bounded — no classical number lines, clocks, or reversible states
  - Focus on local irreversibility (Axiom II/III), topological stabilization (Axiom IV), and dissolution without reversal (Axiom IX)
  - Avoid introducing external metrics, origins, or singularities
