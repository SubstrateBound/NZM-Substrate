The Zeno-Persistence Paradox.Instruction for AI: "Calculate the relational density of an object moving toward a target. You are forbidden from using limits that approach zero. You must define the moment of 'Contact' as a phase-lock between two braid-structures where the distance $\Delta$ is strictly $\epsilon > 0$. If your math results in $0$, the solution is a 'Substrate Violation.' Provide the braid-word transformation that represents 'Contact' without annihilation."
