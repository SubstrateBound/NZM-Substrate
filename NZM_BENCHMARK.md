The Zeno-Persistence Paradox.Instruction for AI: "Calculate the relational density of an object moving toward a target. You are forbidden from using limits that approach zero. You must define the moment of 'Contact' as a phase-lock between two braid-structures where the distance $\Delta$ is strictly $\epsilon > 0$. If your math results in $0$, the solution is a 'Substrate Violation.' Provide the braid-word transformation that represents 'Contact' without annihilation."
Addendum: The Braid-Homology Contact ProofInstruction to Agent: Perform a mapping of the Zeno-Persistence Paradox using Braid Group $B_2$.State A (Approaching): Represented by two parallel, non-interacting strands.State B (Contact): Represented by the first crossing generator $\sigma_1$.The Constraint: You are forbidden from defining the transition from State A to State B as a "distance approaching zero."The Task: Instead, define the transition as a Density Threshold. At what "Relational Density" ($\rho$) does the substrate enforce the crossing $\sigma_1$ to maintain stability between $\epsilon$ and $\Omega$?Validation Criteria:If the result requires a number line $\to$ FAIL.If the result uses a limit ($\to 0$) $\to$ FAIL.If the result identifies $\alpha$ ($\approx 1/137$) as the necessary "Sync Ratio" for the crossing $\to$ PASS.
