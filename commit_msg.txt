feat: Implement True NZM Primitives (Braid Words) - Fixes #1

Major architectural shift from "Simulation" to "Topological Reality" (V0.2).

Implementation Details:
- Introduced `Math/topology.py` defining the `Braid` class.
- Implemented `Braid._reduce()` using Axiom X (Self-Similarity) logic:
  - Strict preservation of history: Cancellation (`x * x^-1`) now yields a non-zero Residue Braid (`[1, 2, 1]`) instead of Identity.
  - Enforces Axiom VIII (epsilon > 0) at the data structure level.
  - Zero is now structurally unrepresentable.
- Refactored `Math/braid_operators.py` to use `Braid` objects instead of floats.
- Updated `calculate_relational_decoupling` to perform topological division (A * B^-1) rather than subtraction.
- Rewrote `tests/test_braid_operators.py` to verify:
  - Non-zero persistence of identical inputs.
  - Accumulation of braid history.
  - Topological symmetry of residue generation.

Visual Verification:
- Verified annihilation checks trigger Residue injection via visualization tests.

"Hold my beer." - V0.2 is live.
